Just some random features I wanted from a discord bot.

# Features

- Send & play local audio/video files in your current voice channel (most bots can only play online (e.g. Youtube) videos for some reason)
- Skip the currently playing file
- Random commands I wrote while finding out how discord.py works

# Deployment

I'm mostly writing this down so I remember it when I come back to this in the future.

- Running it on gameserver.gratis for free atm, let's see how long that will work lol
- Used FTP to transfer the files on there, using a git repo didn't want to work
- FFMPEG was preinstalled there
